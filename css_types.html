        <p>Nature refers to the physical world, including plants, animals, and landscapes, as well as the non-living components like air, water, and soil. It encompasses all living and non-living things and the processes that occur without human intervention. Beyond its physical definition, nature is also understood as an inherent character or constitution, vital for human physical and mental health, providing inspiration and a sense of place in the world.
